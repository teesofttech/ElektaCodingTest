Explanation of Changes:

The code has been organized into separate classes for Pets, Pet types (Dog and Cat), and the report generation logic.

Property names have been capitalized (e.g., FirstName, LastName) for consistency and to follow C# naming conventions.

A constructor has been added to the Pet class to ensure that pets are properly initialized when created.

The unnecessary inheritance of the Pet class by the Owner class has been removed since it didn't serve any purpose in the context of this code.

A dedicated PetReportGenerator class is responsible for generating the pet report, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

Meaningful variable and method names have been used, making the code more self-explanatory.

The unit test Pet_Report_Should_Return_Generate_CSV_Valid has been added to validate the functionality of the code.

These changes improve the code's readability, maintainability, and adherence to SOLID and clean code principles, as well as providing a more object-oriented structure.
